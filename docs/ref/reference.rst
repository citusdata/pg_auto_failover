pg_autoctl commands reference
=============================

pg_auto_failover comes with a PostgreSQL extension and a service:

  - The *pgautofailover* PostgreSQL extension implements the pg_auto_failover monitor.
  - The ``pg_autoctl`` command manages pg_auto_failover services.

pg_autoctl
----------

The ``pg_autoctl`` command implements a service that is meant to run in the
background. The command line controls the service, and uses the service API
for manual operations.

The pg_auto_failover service implements the steps to set up replication and node
promotion according to instructions from the pg_auto_failover monitor. Every 5
seconds, the keeper service (started by ``pg_autoctl run``) connects to the
PostgreSQL monitor database and runs ``SELECT pg_auto_failover.node_active(...)``
to simultaneously communicate its current state and obtain its goal state. It
stores its current state in its own state file, as configured.

The ``pg_autoctl`` command includes facilities for initializing and operating
both the pg_auto_failover monitor and the PostgreSQL instances with a pg_auto_failover
keeper::

The first step consists of creating a pg_auto_failover monitor thanks to the
command ``pg_autoctl create monitor``, and the command ``pg_autoctl show
uri`` can then be used to find the Postgres connection URI string to use as
the ``--monitor`` option to the ``pg_autoctl create`` command for the other
nodes of the formation.

.. _pg_autoctl_create_monitor:

pg_auto_failover Monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main piece of the pg_auto_failover deployment is the monitor. The following
commands are dealing with the monitor:

  - ``pg_autoctl create monitor``

     This command initializes a PostgreSQL cluster and installs the
     `pgautofailover` extension so that it's possible to use the new
     instance to monitor PostgreSQL services::

      $ pg_autoctl create monitor --help
      pg_autoctl create monitor: Initialize a pg_auto_failover monitor node
      usage: pg_autoctl create monitor  [ --pgdata --pgport --pgctl --nodename ]

        --pgctl       path to pg_ctl
        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --pgport      PostgreSQL's port number
        --nodename    hostname by which postgres is reachable
        --auth        authentication method for connections from data nodes
        --skip-pg-hba skip editing pg_hba.conf rules
        --run         create node then run pg_autoctl service

     The ``--pgdata`` option is mandatory and default to the environment
     variable ``PGDATA``. The ``--pgport`` default value is 5432, and the
     ``--pgctl`` option defaults to the first ``pg_ctl`` entry found in your
     `PATH`.

     The ``--nodename`` option allows setting the hostname that the other
     nodes of the cluster will use to access to the monitor. When not
     provided, a default value is computed by running the following
     algorithm:

       1. Open a connection to the 8.8.8.8:53 public service and looks the
          TCP/IP client address that has been used to make that connection.

       2. Do a reverse DNS lookup on this IP address to fetch a hostname for
          our local machine.

       3. If the reverse DNS lookup is successfull , then `pg_autoctl` does
          with a forward DNS lookup of that hostname.

     When the forward DNS lookup repsonse in step 3. is an IP address found
     in one of our local network interfaces, then `pg_autoctl` uses the
     hostname found in step 2. as the default `--nodename`. Otherwise it
     uses the IP address found in step 1.

     You may use the `--nodename` command line option to bypass the whole
     DNS lookup based process and force the local node name to a fixed
     value.

     The ``--auth`` option allows setting up authentication method to be
     used for connections from data nodes with ``autoctl_node`` user. When
     testing pg_auto_failover for the first time using ``--auth trust``
     makes things easier. When getting production ready, review your options
     here and choose at least ``--auth scram-sha-256`` and make sure
     password is manually set on the monitor, and appropriate setting is
     added to `.pgpass` file on data node. You could also use some of the
     advanced Postgres authentication mechanism such as SSL certificates.

     See :ref:`pg_auto_failover_security` for notes on `.pgpass`

  - ``pg_autoctl run``

    This command makes sure that the PostgreSQL instance for the monitor is
    running, then connects to it and listens to the monitor notifications,
    displaying them as log messages::

      $ pg_autoctl run --help
      pg_autoctl run: Run the pg_autoctl service (monitor or keeper)
      usage: pg_autoctl run  [ --pgdata ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory

    The option `--pgdata` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``) allows
    pg_auto_failover to find the monitor configuration file.

  - ``pg_autoctl create formation``

    This command registers a new formation on the monitor, with the
    specified kind::

      $ pg_autoctl create formation --help
      pg_autoctl create formation: Create a new formation on the pg_auto_failover monitor
      usage: pg_autoctl create formation  [ --pgdata --formation --kind --dbname --with-secondary --without-secondary ]

        --pgdata            path to data directory
        --formation         name of the formation to create
        --kind              formation kind, either "pgsql" or "citus"
        --dbname            name for postgres database to use in this formation
        --enable-secondary  create a formation that has multiple nodes that can be
                            used for fail over when others have issues
        --disable-secondary create a citus formation without nodes to fail over to


  - ``pg_autoctl drop formation``

    This command drops an existing formation on the monitor::

      $ pg_autoctl drop formation --help
      pg_autoctl drop formation: Drop a formation on the pg_auto_failover monitor
      usage: pg_autoctl drop formation  [ --pgdata --formation ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   name of the formation to drop


pg_autoctl show command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To discover current information about a pg_auto_failover setup, the
``pg_autoctl show`` commands can be used, from any node in the setup.

  - ``pg_autoctl show uri``

    This command outputs the monitor or the coordinator Postgres URI to use
    from an application to connect to the service::

      $ pg_autoctl show uri --help
      pg_autoctl show uri: Show the postgres uri to use to connect to pg_auto_failover nodes
      usage: pg_autoctl show uri  [ --pgdata --formation ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   show the coordinator uri of given formation

    The option ``--formation default`` outputs the Postgres URI to use to
    connect to the Postgres server.

  - ``pg_autoctl show events``

    This command outputs the latest events known to the pg_auto_failover monitor::

      $ pg_autoctl show events --help
      pg_autoctl show events: Prints monitor's state of nodes in a given formation and group
      usage: pg_autoctl show events  [ --pgdata --formation --group --count ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   formation to query, defaults to 'default'
        --group       group to query formation, defaults to all
        --count       how many events to fetch, defaults to 10

    The events are available in the ``pgautofailover.event`` table in the
    PostgreSQL instance where the monitor runs, so the ``pg_autoctl show
    events`` command needs to be able to connect to the monitor. To this
    end, the ``--pgdata`` option is used either to determine a local
    PostgreSQL instance to connect to, when used on the monitor, or to
    determine the pg_auto_failover keeper configuration file and read the monitor
    URI from there.

    See below for more information about ``pg_auto_failover`` configuration files.

    The options ``--formation`` and ``--group`` allow to filter the output
    to a single formation, and group. The ``--count`` option limits the
    output to that many lines.

  - ``pg_autoctl show state``

    This command outputs the current state of the formation and groups
    registered to the pg_auto_failover monitor::

      $ pg_autoctl show state --help
      pg_autoctl show state: Prints monitor's state of nodes in a given formation and group
      usage: pg_autoctl show state  [ --pgdata --formation --group ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --formation   formation to query, defaults to 'default'
        --group       group to query formation, defaults to all

    For details about the options to the command, see above in the ``pg_autoctl
    show events`` command.

  - ``pg_autoctl show file``

    This command outputs the configuration, state, initial state, and pid
    files used by this instance. The files are placed in a path that follows
    the `XDG Base Directory Specification
    <https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_
    and in a way allows to find them when given only ``$PGDATA``, as in
    PostgreSQL::

      $ pg_autoctl show file --help
      pg_autoctl show file: List pg_autoctl internal files (config, state, pid)
      usage: pg_autoctl show file  [ --pgdata --all --config | --state | --init | --pid --contents ]

        --pgdata      path to data directory
        --all         show all pg_autoctl files
        --config      show pg_autoctl configuration file
        --state       show pg_autoctl state file
        --init        show pg_autoctl initialisation state file
        --pid         show pg_autoctl PID file
        --contents    show selected file contents

    The command ``pg_auctoctl show file`` outputs a JSON object with the
    single key ``config`` for a monitor, and with the four keys ``config``,
    ``state``, ``init``, and ``pid`` for a keeper. When one of the options
    with the same name is used, a single line containing only the file path
    is printed.

    Here's an example of the JSON output::

      $ pg_autoctl show file --pgdata /data/pgsql
      {
        "config": "/Users/dim/.config/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.cfg",
        "state": "/Users/dim/.local/share/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.state",
        "init": "/Users/dim/.local/share/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.init",
        "pid": "/private/tmp/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.pid"
      }


  - ``pg_autoctl show systemd``

    This command outputs a configuration unit that is suitable for
    registering ``pg_autoctl`` as a systemd service.


.. _pg_autoctl_create_postgres:

pg_auto_failover Postgres Node Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Initializing a pg_auto_failover Postgres node is done with one of the available
``pg_autoctl create`` commands, depending on which kind of node is to be
initialized:

  - monitor

    The pg_auto_failover monitor is a special case and has been documented in the
    previous sections.

  - postgres

    The command ``pg_autoctl create postgres`` initializes a standalone
    Postgres node to a pg_auto_failover monitor. The monitor is then handling
    auto-failover for this Postgres node (as soon as a secondary has been
    registered too, and is known to be healthy).

Here's the full help message for the ``pg_autoctl create postgres`` command.
The other commands accept the same set of options.

::

  $ pg_autoctl create postgres --help
  pg_autoctl create postgres: Initialize a pg_auto_failover standalone postgres node
  usage: pg_autoctl create postgres

    --pgctl       path to pg_ctl
    --pgdata      path to data director
    --pghost      PostgreSQL's hostname
    --pgport      PostgreSQL's port number
    --listen      PostgreSQL's listen_addresses
    --username    PostgreSQL's username
    --dbname      PostgreSQL's database name
    --nodename    pg_auto_failover node
    --formation   pg_auto_failover formation
    --monitor     pg_auto_failover Monitor Postgres URL
    --auth        authentication method for connections from monitor
    --skip-pg-hba skip editing pg_hba.conf rules
    --allow-removing-pgdata Allow pg_autoctl to remove the database directory

Three different modes of initialization are supported by this command,
corresponding to as many implementation strategies.

  1. Initialize a primary node from scratch

     This happens when ``--pgdata`` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``)
     points to an non-existing or empty directory. Then the given
     ``--nodename`` is registered to the pg_auto_failover ``--monitor`` as a
     member of the ``--formation``.

     The monitor answers to the registration call with a state to assign to
     the new member of the group, either *SINGLE* or *WAIT_STANDBY*. When
     the assigned state is *SINGLE*, then ``pg_autoctl create postgres``
     procedes to initialize a new PostgreSQL instance.

  2. Initialize an already existing primary server

     This happens when ``--pgdata`` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``)
     points to an already existing directory that belongs to a PostgreSQL
     instance. The standard PostgreSQL tool ``pg_controldata`` is used to
     recognize whether the directory belongs to a PostgreSQL instance.

     In that case, the given ``--nodename`` is registered to the monitor in
     the tentative *SINGLE* state. When the given ``--formation`` and
     ``--group`` is currently empty, then the monitor accepts the
     registration and the ``pg_autoctl create`` prepares the already existing
     primary server for pg_auto_failover.

  3. Initialize a secondary node from scratch

     This happens when ``--pgdata`` (or the environment variable ``PGDATA``)
     points to a non-existing or empty directory, and when the monitor
     registration call assigns the state *WAIT_STANDBY* in step 1.

     In that case, the ``pg_autoctl create`` command steps through the initial
     states of registering a secondary server, which includes preparing the
     primary server PostgreSQL HBA rules and creating a replication slot.

     When the command ends succesfully, a PostgreSQL secondary server has
     been created with ``pg_basebackup`` and is now started, catching-up to
     the primary server.

Currently, ``pg_autoctl create`` doesn't know how to initialize from an already
running PostgreSQL standby node. In that situation, it is necessary to
prepare a new secondary system from scratch.

When `--nodename` is omitted, it is computed as above (see
:ref:`pg_autoctl_create_monitor`), with the difference that step 1 uses the
monitor IP and port rather than the public service 8.8.8.8:53.

The ``--auth`` option allows setting up authentication method to be used
when monitor node makes a connection to data node with
`pgautofailover_monitor` user. As with the ``pg_autoctl create monitor``
command, you could use ``--auth trust`` when playing with pg_auto_failover
at first and consider something production grade later. Also, consider using
``--skip-pg-hba`` if you already have your own provisioning tools with a
security compliance process.

See :ref:`pg_auto_failover_security` for notes on `.pgpass`

.. _pg_autoctl_configuration:

pg_autoctl configuration and state files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When initializing a pg_auto_failover keeper service via pg_autoctl, both a configuration file and a
state file are created. pg_auto_failover follows the `XDG Base Directory
Specification
<https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_.

When initializing a pg_auto_failover keeper with ``--pgdata /data/pgsql``, then:

  - ``~/.config/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.cfg``

    is the configuration file for the PostgreSQL instance located at
    ``/data/pgsql``, written in the INI file format.

    It is possible to get the location of the configuration file by using
    the command ``pg_autoctl show file --config --pgdata /data/pgsql`` and
    to output its content by using the command ``pg_autoctl show
    file --config --content --pgdata /data/pgsql``.

    Here's an example of such a configuration file::

      [pg_autoctl]
      role = keeper
      monitor = postgres://autoctl_node@192.168.1.34:6000/pg_auto_failover
      formation = default
      group = 1
      nodename = node1.db

      [postgresql]
      pgdata = /data/pgsql/
      pg_ctl = /usr/pgsql-10/bin/pg_ctl
      dbname = postgres
      host = /tmp
      port = 5000

      [replication]
      slot = pgautofailover_standby
      maximum_backup_rate = 100M

      [timeout]
      network_partition_timeout = 20
      prepare_promotion_catchup = 30
      prepare_promotion_walreceiver = 5
      postgresql_restart_failure_timeout = 20
      postgresql_restart_failure_max_retries = 3

    It is possible to edit the configuration file with a tooling of your
    choice, and with the ``pg_autoctl config`` subcommands, see below.

  - ``~/.local/share/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.state``

    is the state file for the pg_auto_failover keeper service taking care of the
    PostgreSQL instance located at ``/data/pgsql``, written in binary
    format. This file is not intended to be written by anything else than
    ``pg_autoctl`` itself. In case of state corruption, see the trouble
    shooting section of the documentation.

    It is possible to get the location of the state file by using the
    command ``pg_autoctl show file --state --pgdata /data/pgsql`` and to
    output its content by using the command ``pg_autoctl show
    file --state --content --pgdata /data/pgsql``. Here's an example of the
    output when using that command::

      $ pg_autoctl show file --state --content --pgdata /data/pgsql
      Current Role:             secondary
      Assigned Role:            secondary
      Last Monitor Contact:     Mon Dec 23 13:31:23 2019
      Last Secondary Contact:   0
      pg_autoctl state version: 1
      group:                    0
      node id:                  1
      nodes version:            0
      PostgreSQL Version:       1100
      PostgreSQL CatVersion:    201809051
      PostgreSQL System Id:     6772497431723510412

  - ``~/.local/share/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.init``

    is the initial state file for the pg_auto_failover keeper service taking
    care of the PostgreSQL instance located at ``/data/pgsql``, written in
    binary format. This file is not intended to be written by anything else
    than ``pg_autoctl`` itself. In case of state corruption, see the trouble
    shooting section of the documentation.

    This initialization state file only exists during the initialization of
    a pg_auto_failover node. In normal operations, this file does not
    exists.

    It is possible to get the location of the state file by using the
    command ``pg_autoctl show file --init --pgdata /data/pgsql`` and to
    output its content by using the command ``pg_autoctl show
    file --init --content --pgdata /data/pgsql``.

  - ``/tmp/pg_autoctl/data/pgsql/pg_autoctl.pid``

    is the PID file for the ``pg_autoctl`` service, located in a temporary
    directory by default, or in the ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` directory when this
    is setup.

    The PID file contains a single line with the PID of the running
    ``pg_autoctl`` process, and is supposed to only exists when the process
    is running. Stale PID files are detected automatically by sending the
    signal 0 to the PID.

To output, edit and check entries of the configuration, the following
commands are provided. Both commands need the `--pgdata` option or the
`PGDATA` environment variable to be set in order to find the intended
configuration file::

  pg_autoctl config check [--pgdata <pgdata>]
  pg_autoctl config get [--pgdata <pgdata>] section.option
  pg_autoctl config set [--pgdata <pgdata>] section.option value

Running the pg_auto_failover Keeper service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the pg_auto_failover keeper as a background service in your OS, use the
following command::

  $ pg_autoctl run --help
  pg_autoctl run: Run the pg_autoctl service (monitor or keeper)
  usage: pg_autoctl run  [ --pgdata ]

    --pgdata      path to data directory

Thanks to using the XDG Base Directory Specification for our configuration
and state file, the only option needed to run the service is ``--pgdata``,
which defaults to the environment variable ``PGDATA``.

Removing a node from the pg_auto_failover monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To clean-up an installation and remove a PostgreSQL instance from pg_auto_failover
keeper and monitor, use the following command::

    $ pg_autoctl drop node --help
    pg_autoctl drop node: Drop a node from the pg_auto_failover monitor
    usage: pg_autoctl drop node [ --pgdata --destroy --nodename --nodeport ]

      --pgdata      path to data directory
      --destroy     also destroy Postgres database
      --nodename    nodename to remove from the monitor
      --nodeport    Postgres port of the node to remove

The ``pg_autoctl drop node`` connects to the monitor and removes the
nodename from it, then removes the local pg_auto_failover keeper state file. The
configuration file is not removed.

It is possible to run the ``pg_autoctl drop node`` command either from the
node itself and then the ``--destroy`` option is available to wipe out
everything, including configuration files and PGDATA; or to run the command
from the monitor and then use the ``--nodename`` and ``--nodeport`` options
to target a (presumably dead) node to remove from the monitor registration.

pg_autoctl do
-------------

When testing pg_auto_failover, it is helpful to be able to play with the
local nodes using the same lower-level API as used by the pg_auto_failover
Finite State Machine transitions. The low-level API is made available
through the following commands, only available in debug environments::

  $ PG_AUTOCTL_DEBUG=1 pg_autoctl help
